# Bomb Catcher
Bomb Catcher is an addictive game to test your reactions. The game is simple. Defuse the bombs before the explode. When the game starts use your fingers to tap or click  the lit bombs. How many bombs will you be able to defuse, will you set the new high score. For a challenge increase the game difficulty and create your own custom session by changing the grid size, increasing the number of bombs or shorten the fuse time.

### Accessibility Testing

To check the colors and fonts, I used Lighthouse in the Google devtools. The results are shown below:

| Index  |

### Manual Testing - X
- I have tested that this page works in different web browsers.
- I have tested that the project is responsive and works with different device sizes. It looks good and functions as normal. 
- I have tested all links, internal and external. They go to the correct destination and open in the correct way. 
- I have tested that all text and fonts are readable and easy to understand.
- I have tested that the correct data is passed when the forms are submitted. 
- I have tested that the sorts for high scores work correctly.
- I have tested that the user can add a high score to local storage.
- I have tested sound plays at the correct time during the game
- I have tested the bombs change colour when ignited
- I have tested that the eplode image appears when a bomb explodes
- I have tested that pressijg or tapping a bomb defuses it

This is a sample of shots of what the site looks like on different devices.

### Fixed Bugs - X

#### Sound

#### Rotation 
When on a mobile device the user has the ability to rotate the device. When this happened the bomb grid would appear ofF the screen and would not resize. I used the JQuery commmand to put the bombs into a new ratio aspect that allowed the grid to resize on the screen and use the 'vh' to workout the size of the grid. The function is called when the 'vw' is larger than the 'vh'.

Below is an example of the fixed feature. 

- Portrait game

- Landscape game
