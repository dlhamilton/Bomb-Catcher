# Bomb Catcher
Bomb Catcher is an addictive game to test your reactions. The game is simple. Defuse the bombs before the explode. When the game starts use your fingers to tap or click  the lit bombs. How many bombs will you be able to defuse, will you set the new high score. For a challenge increase the game difficulty and create your own custom session by changing the grid size, increasing the number of bombs or shorten the fuse time.
